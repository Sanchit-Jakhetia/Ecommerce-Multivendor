# Chatbot Implementation Guide

## Overview
The chatbot has been successfully integrated into your e-commerce website with the following features:

### Features Implemented:
1. **Google Gemini AI Integration** - Uses your provided API key
2. **Authentication-based Visibility** - Only shows when users are logged in
3. **Mobile-First Responsive Design** - Adapts to all screen sizes
4. **Position in Bottom-Right** - Fixed position for easy access
5. **Conversation Memory** - Maintains context of previous messages

### Files Created/Modified:

#### New Files:
- `frontend/components/chatbot.html` - Chatbot UI component
- `frontend/js/chatbot.js` - Main chatbot functionality

#### Modified Files:
- `frontend/css/style.css` - Added responsive chatbot styles
- `frontend/js/auth.js` - Added chatbot initialization on login/logout
- `frontend/index.html` - Added chatbot script
- `frontend/cart.html` - Added chatbot script
- `frontend/product.html` - Added chatbot script
- `frontend/seller-dashboard.html` - Added chatbot script
- `frontend/checkout.html` - Added chatbot script
- `frontend/categories.html` - Added chatbot script

### How It Works:

1. **Authentication Check**: Chatbot only appears when user is logged in
2. **Responsive Design**: 
   - Desktop: 22rem × 28rem window in bottom-right
   - Tablet: Adjusts size to fit screen
   - Mobile: Takes full width with max constraints
3. **Mobile-First CSS**: Uses progressive enhancement for larger screens

### Responsive Breakpoints:
- **Mobile (≤640px)**: Full-width chat window, smaller toggle button
- **Small Mobile (≤480px)**: Optimized padding and sizing
- **Tiny Mobile (≤360px)**: Minimal dimensions for very small screens

### Usage:
1. User must be logged in to see the chatbot
2. Click the blue chat icon in bottom-right corner
3. Chat window opens with welcome message
4. Type messages and get AI-powered responses
5. Click minimize or chat icon again to close

### API Integration:
- Uses Google Gemini Pro model
- Implements safety filters
- Handles API errors gracefully
- Maintains conversation context (last 10 messages)

### Testing:
To test the chatbot:
1. Start your backend server
2. Open any page (index.html, cart.html, etc.)
3. Log in with a valid user account
4. The blue chat icon should appear in bottom-right
5. Click to open and start chatting

### Customization:
You can customize:
- Colors in CSS (change blue-600 to your brand colors)
- Chat window size (modify width/height in CSS)
- Welcome message (in chatbot.html)
- AI personality (modify systemContext in chatbot.js)

The implementation is complete and ready for use!
